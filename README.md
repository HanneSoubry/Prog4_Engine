# Minigin

Minigin is a small 2D Game Engine that I made for the course Programming 4 (Digital Arts & Entertainment - major Game Development). 
I started from a framework that we got from our teachers and build and expanded the engine during the semester. 
To prove the working of the engine, I made a simple example game based on BurgerTime.
